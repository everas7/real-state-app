DB_PASSWORD= DB_P@$$w0rd
DB_DATABASE= demo_ar_db
DB_HOST= localhost
DB_PORT= 3306
JWT_SECRET= top_secret_key_for_jwt_auth
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=yourcloudname
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=youcapikey
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=yourapisecret
```


### Webapp
Copy the .env.example file:
```
cp .env.example .env
```

Modify variables on .env as needed. For example:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:7000/api
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY=yourkey
```
Note: The port must be the one where the api is being served.

# Project Instructions

- Users must be able to create an account and log in.
- Implement a client role:
   - Clients are able to browse rentable apartments in a list and on a map.
- Implement a realtor role:
   - Realtors would be able to browse all rentable- and already rented apartments in a list and on a map.
   - Realtors would be able to CRUD all apartments and set the apartment state to available/rented.
- Implement an admin role:
   - Admins would be able CRUD all apartments, realtors, and clients.
- When an apartment is added, each new entry must have a name, description, floor area size, price per month, number of rooms, valid geolocation coordinates, date added and an associated realtor.
- Geolocation coordinates should be added either by providing latitude/longitude directly or through address geocoding (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding).
- All users should be able to filter the displayed apartments by size, price, and the number of rooms.
- REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you donâ€™t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
In both cases, you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly. Please be prepared to use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc. for this purpose.
- If it's a web application, it must be a single-page application. All actions need to be done client-side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. (If a mobile application, disregard this).
- Functional UI/UX design is needed. You are not required to create a unique design, however, do follow best practices to make the project as functional as possible.
- Bonus: unit and e2e tests.
